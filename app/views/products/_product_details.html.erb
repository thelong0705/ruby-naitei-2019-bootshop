  <h4>Editorial Reviews</h4>
  <h5>Manufacturer's Description </h5>
  <p>
    With a generous 18x Fujinon optical zoom lens, the S2950 really packs a punch, especially when matched with
    its 14 megapixel sensor, large 3.0" LCD screen and 720p HD (30fps) movie capture.
  </p>

  <h5>Electric powered Fujinon 18x zoom lens</h5>
  <p>
    The S2950 sports an impressive 28mm – 504mm* high precision Fujinon optical zoom lens. Simple to operate
    with an electric powered zoom lever, the huge zoom range means that you can capture all the detail, even
    when you're at a considerable distance away. You can even operate the zoom during video shooting. Unlike a
    bulky D-SLR, bridge cameras allow you great versatility of zoom, without the hassle of carrying a bag of
    lenses.
  </p>
  <h5>Impressive panoramas</h5>
  <p>
    With its easy to use Panoramic shooting mode you can get creative on the S2950, however basic your skills,
    and rest assured that you will not risk shooting uneven landscapes or shaky horizons. The camera enables you
    to take three successive shots with a helpful tool which automatically releases the shutter once the images
    are fully aligned to seamlessly stitch the shots together in-camera. It's so easy and the results are
    impressive.
  </p>

  <h5>Sharp, clear shots</h5>
  <p>
    Even at the longest zoom settings or in the most challenging of lighting conditions, the S2950 is able to
    produce crisp, clean results. With its mechanically stabilised 1/2 3", 14 megapixel CCD sensor, and high ISO
    sensitivity settings, Fujifilm's Dual Image Stabilisation technology combines to reduce the blurring effects
    of both hand-shake and subject movement to provide superb pictures.
